# nix-config
Config for nixos, some parts are unnecessarily here,
they will be exported to home-manager config at some time

Most work was done

Most work left is:
- port to flakes which may be impossible because
of hardware configuration (i want it to stay local)
- use something more advanced for secrets than local file
